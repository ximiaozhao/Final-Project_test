Trump’s finances, who concluded that the real-estate developer’s net worth was $150 million to $250 million, rather than the $2 billion to $5 billion Trump had variously claimed. Trump, who had courted O’Brien by taking him for rides in his Ferrari and private jet, sued O’Brien for libel in New Jersey in 2006. Trump called O’Brien a “wack job” on the “Today” show — while, O’Brien says, continuing to curry favor with him privately. O’Brien’s publisher, Warner Books, was also named in the suit and hired top lawyers who put Trump through an unsparing two-day deposition. Asked about his finances, Trump was caught lying or exaggerating 30 times. “He thought he’d get a friendly judge, and we would roll over,” says O’Brien, who is now the executive editor of Bloomberg View. “We didn’t.” The case went through four judges and was dismissed in 2009.","MM","50","The New York Times","2016-11-22T10:00:06+0000","article","Magazine","Magazine","News","nyt://article/f380398d-589b-5e32-ac83-1f9b79196629",2903,"nyt://article/f380398d-589b-5e32-ac83-1f9b79196629",NA,"Billionaires vs. the Press in the Era of Trump","Feature",NA,"Stop the Presses",NA,NA,NA,"By Emily Bazelon",NA
