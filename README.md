To answer these questions, the study collected NYT articles published in November 2016 and November 2024. For Q1, sentiment analysis results indicate that NYT Trump coverage in 2024 is slightly more negative compared to 2016. For Q2, the term frequency analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling results reveal that in 2016, NYT coverage primarily focused on Trump's winning and his opponent, while in 2024, the focus shifted to his future domestic policies and current global issues.
